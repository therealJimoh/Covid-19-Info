    <h1>CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h1>
    <p>
        Coronavirus also know as Covid-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by a 
        newly identified virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
        which belongs to the coronavirus family (Kathleen, 2020). The first cases were seen in Wuhan, 
        China, in December 2019 before spreading globally  <br> <br>
        Let's bust some myths circulating. SARS-CoV is zoonotic in origin - virus that circulate among
        animals with some also known to infect humans. The virus is transmitted through direct contact 
        with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and 
        touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for 
        several hours. These droplets can then be inhaled, or they can land on surfaces that others
        may come into contact with, who can then get infected when they touch their nose, mouth or 
        eyes. The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours (copper, cardboard) 
        up to a few days (plastic and stainless steel) but simple disinfectants can kill it (ECDPC, 2020).

    <p>On 10 April 2020, the number of cases 
        of confirmed COVID-19 globally was over 1.56 million 5. COVID-19 has now been diagnosed in 
        184 territories, in six continents according to an online virus tracker created by the medical 
        journal, The Lancet, and hosted by Johns Hopkins University.</p>

    <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
    
    <P>
        COVID-19 typically presents with systemic and/or respiratory manifestations. Some individuals 
        infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic and can act as carriers. The symptoms are usually mild 
        and tend to begin 2–14 days after exposure. Although the symptoms may vary from person to person,
        the CDC reports the most common symptoms as: 
        <ul>
            <li>a fever</li>
            <li> a cough, which is usually dry</li>
            <li>shortness of breath</li>
            <li>sore throat</li>
        </ul>
    </P>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="img/symptoms-img.png" alt="symptoms" class="symptoms-img">
    </div>
    <p> 
        <b>WHO</b> states that other symptoms can include:
        <ul>
            <li>aches and pains</li>
            <li>in rare cases, diarrhoe, nausea, or a runny nose</li>
            <li>palpitation, chest tightness</li>
        </ul>
        The virus is still being studies and full list of syptoms are still being investigated.

    <h2>PREVENTIVE MEASURES</h2>

    <P>
      There is currently no cure/vaccine for covid-19 but you can protect yourself from contracting it
      and help prevent the spread of the virus with everyday preventive actions:
      <ul>

<section id="faq">
    <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</h2>
        <p>I know you have questions to ask and I hope this answers all the questions
            bothering you. </p>
        
    <h4> 
        How Does the COVID-19 Virus Spread?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an 
        infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces 
        contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several
        hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.
    </p>
    <h4>What Causes Coronaviruses?</h4>
    <p>
        Coronaviruses are zoonotic. This means they first develop in animals before developing in humans. 
        For the virus to pass from animal to humans, a person has to come into close contact with an animal
        that carries the infection.Once the virus develops in people, coronaviruses can be spread from person
        to person through respiratory droplets. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        Is there a Vaccine?
    </h4>
    <p>
        There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The
        best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive
        actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and
        washing your hands often. 
    </p>
    <h4>Is there a Treatment?</h4>
    <p>
        There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
        People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help
        relieve symptoms.    
    </p>
    <h4>Should I Wear Medical Mask?</h4>
    <p>The use of a medical mask is advised if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing) to protect others. 
        If you don’t have any symptoms, then there is no need to wear a mask. If masks are worn, they must be used and disposed 
        of properly to ensure their effectiveness and to avoid any increased  risk of transmitting the virus. The use of a mask 
        alone is not enough to stop infections and must be combined with frequent hand washing, covering sneezes
        and coughs, and avoiding close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms (coughing, sneezing, fever).</p>
        <h4>
            What Should I do if a Family Member/ Friends Displays Symptoms?
        </h4>
        <p>
            You should seek medical care early if you or your close relation has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Consider calling 
            ahead to tell your health care provider. If you have traveled to an area where COVID-19 has been reported, or if you
             have been in close contact with someone with who has traveled from one of these areas and has respiratory symptoms. You should pick 
             up your phone and dial the NCDC covid-19 hotlines.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Is There Specific Drug for Covid-19?
        </h4>
        <p>NOT YET! However clinical trials are on going to find an effective drug.</p>
        <h4>
            Who Can Get Tested?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Anyone with travel history outside Nigeria, who presents with fever, cough or breathing with fever, cough or breathing difficulties
            within 14 days of arrival and anyone who has demonstrated the symptoms.
        </p>
        <h4>
            How Do I Stop the Spread of Covid-19?
        </h4>
        <p>
            It is your responsibility to STAY IN YOUR HOUSE and avoid mass gathering of people. Practice good public hygiene.
